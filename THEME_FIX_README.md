# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix for Theme Switching

## Problem
The website was showing black text initially on page load, then switching to white text after a brief moment. This was more pronounced on GitHub Pages due to static file serving and caching.

## Root Cause
- Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) occurring during theme initialization
- Theme switching script running after initial CSS parsing
- CSS variables not being set immediately on page load

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Theme Script Optimization (`app/theme-script.tsx`)
- Added immediate theme detection and application
- Handles localStorage unavailability (common in GitHub Pages)
- Falls back to system preference when localStorage is blocked
- Sets theme before CSS parsing completes

### 2. Layout Updates (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Added color-scheme meta tag for better browser optimization
- Removed hardcoded data-bs-theme attribute to prevent conflicts
- Integrated theme script in document head

### 3. CSS Enhancements (`app/globals.css`)
- Added FOUC prevention with visibility controls
- Implemented smooth theme transitions
- Added specific overrides for text-dark class in both themes
- Forced immediate color application for critical elements

### 4. Component Updates (`components/elements/ThemeSwitch.tsx`)
- Improved hydration mismatch prevention
- Enhanced client-side theme detection
- Added mounted state to prevent SSR issues

## Deployment Steps for GitHub Pages

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **The build creates static files in the `out` directory**

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   - The `.nojekyll` file is already in place
   - Static export is configured in `next.config.mjs`
   - Files will be served correctly from GitHub Pages

## Testing the Fix

1. **Local testing:**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`
   - Refresh the page multiple times
   - Text should appear white immediately without flashing black

2. **GitHub Pages testing:**
   - Deploy the built files to GitHub Pages
   - Test with browser dev tools throttling
   - Test with cache disabled
   - Text should load with correct colors immediately

## Additional Considerations

- The fix handles cases where localStorage is not available
- Graceful fallback to system color preference
- Optimized for static site generation
- Compatible with GitHub Pages caching policies

## Files Modified

- `app/layout.tsx` - Enhanced HTML structure and meta tags
- `app/theme-script.tsx` - New optimized theme detection
- `app/globals.css` - FOUC prevention and color fixes
- `components/elements/ThemeSwitch.tsx` - Improved hydration handling
